## Performance Considerations

1. **Efficient Filtering**: Apply filters in memory to avoid unnecessary re-renders
2. **Lazy Loading**: Use skeleton UI during data loading
3. **Optimized Renders**: Prevent unnecessary re-renders with proper component structure
4. **Debounced Search**: Implement debounce for search inputs to limit rendering cycles

## Accessibility Features

1. **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
2. **Screen Reader Support**: Semantic HTML with proper ARIA roles
3. **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators and proper tabbing order
4. **Color Contrast**: Maintain WCAG compliance for text contrast ratios

## Error Handling

1. **Empty States**: Display helpful messages when no matches match filters
2. **Loading States**: Show skeleton UI during data loading
3. **Prediction Errors**: Toast notifications for failed predictions
4. **Fallbacks**: Default values for missing data

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Statistics**: More detailed performance metrics
2. **Personalization**: User-based favorite teams and matches
